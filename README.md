# Contact Form
This project was a challenge from the Frontend Mentor. Creating a responsive contact form with error and success notifications, and of course animation. Building accessible forms is a key skill for front-end developers, so this is a perfect challenge to practice.

## Requirements
- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
